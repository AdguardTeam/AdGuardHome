'description': |
  AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After
  you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any
  client-side software for that.

  It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a "black hole,"
  thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It's based
  on software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers -- both share a lot
  of common code.
