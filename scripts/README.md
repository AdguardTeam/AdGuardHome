 #  AdGuard Home Scripts

##  `hooks/`: Git Hooks

   ###  Usage

Run `make init` from the project root.



##  `querylog/`: Query Log Helpers

   ###  Usage

 *  `npm install`: install dependencies.  Run this first.
 *  `npm run anonymize <source> <dst>`: read the query log from the `<source>`
    and write anonymized version to `<dst>`.



##  `make/`: Makefile scripts

The release channels are: `development` (the default), `edge`, `beta`, and
`release`.  If verbosity levels aren't documented here, there are only two: `0`,
don't print anything, and `1`, be verbose.



   ###  `build-docker.sh`: Build a multi-architecture Docker image

Required environment:

 *  `CHANNEL`: release channel, see above.

 *  `COMMIT`: current Git revision.

 *  `DIST_DIR`: the directory where a release has previously been built.

 *  `VERSION`: release version.

Optional environment:

 *  `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME`: the name of the resulting Docker container.  By default
    it's `adguardhome-dev`.

 *  `DOCKER_OUTPUT`: the `--output` parameters.  By default they are
    `type=image,name=${DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME},push=false`.

 *  `SUDO`: allow users to use `sudo` or `doas` with `docker`.  By default none
    is used.



   ###  `build-release.sh`: Build a release for all platforms

Required environment:

 *  `CHANNEL`: release channel, see above.

 *  `GPG_KEY` and `GPG_KEY_PASSPHRASE`: data for `gpg`.  Only required if `SIGN`
    is `1`.

Optional environment:

 *  `ARCH` and `OS`: space-separated list of architectures and operating systems
    for which to build a release.  For example, to build only for 64-bit ARM and
    AMD on Linux and Darwin:

    ```sh
    make ARCH='amd64 arm64' OS='darwin linux' â€¦ build-release
    ```
    The default value is `''`, which means build everything.

 *  `DIST_DIR`: the directory to build a release into.  The default value is
    `dist`.

 *  `GO`: set an alternative name for the Go compiler.

 *  `SIGN`: `0` to not sign the resulting packages, `1` to sign.  The default
    value is `1`.

 *  `VERBOSE`: `1` to be verbose, `2` to also print environment.  This script
    calls `go-build.sh` with the verbosity level one level lower, so to get
    verbosity level `2` in `go-build.sh`, set this to `3` when calling
    `build-release.sh`.

 *  `VERSION`: release version.  Will be set by `version.sh` if it is unset or
    if it has the default `Makefile` value of `v0.0.0`.

We're using Go's [forward compatibility mechanism][go-toolchain] for updating
the Go version.  This means that if your `go` version is 1.21+ but is different
from the one required by AdGuard Home, the `go` tool will automatically download
the required version.

If you want to use the version installed on your builder, run:

```sh
go get go@$YOUR_VERSION
go mod tidy
```

and call `make` with `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`.
