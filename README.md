### What is AdGuard DNS?

AdGuard DNS is an alternative way to block ads, trackers and phishing websites, and also a parental control instrument.

### How does AdGuard DNS work?

If you configure your network to use our DNS servers, every time a website sends an ad or phishing request, our server sends back a null response. AdGuard has a database of domain names that serve for ad, tracking or phishing purposes, and this database is regularly updated.

AdGuard DNS works in two modes:

 - 'Default' mode blocks ads, various trackers and malware & phishing websites. 
 - 'Family protection' does the same, but also blocks websites with adult content.

This repository contains filters used by AdGuard DNS server.

#### DNSCrypt

AdGuard supports DNSCrypt â€” a special protocol that encrypts communication with the DNS server, thus preventing tampering and tracking by any third party, including your ISP. Read more about DNSCrypt [here](https://dnscrypt.info/).

### How to use AdGuard DNS?
