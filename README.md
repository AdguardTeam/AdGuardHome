AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you
set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side
software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”,
thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers.  It's based on
software we use for our public [AdGuard DNS] servers, and both share a lot of
code.

##  <a href="#comparison" id="comparison" name="comparison">Comparing AdGuard Home to other solutions</a>

   ###  <a href="#comparison-adguard-dns" id="comparison-adguard-dns" name="comparison-adguard-dns">How is this different from public AdGuard DNS servers?</a>

Running your own AdGuard Home server allows you to do much more than using a
public DNS server.  It's a completely different level.  See for yourself:

 *  Choose what exactly the server blocks and permits.

 *  Monitor your network activity.

 *  Add your own custom filtering rules.

 *  **Most importantly, it's your own server, and you are the only one who's in
    control.**



   ###  <a href="#comparison-pi-hole" id="comparison-pi-hole" name="comparison-pi-hole">How does AdGuard Home compare to Pi-Hole</a>

At this point, AdGuard Home has a lot in common with Pi-Hole.  Both block ads
and trackers using the so-called “DNS sinkholing” method and both allow
customizing what's blocked.

<aside>
We're not going to stop here.  DNS sinkholing is not a bad starting point, but
this is just the beginning.
</aside>

AdGuard Home provides a lot of features out-of-the-box with no need to install
and configure additional software.  We want it to be simple to the point when
even casual users can set it up with minimal effort.

**Disclaimer:** some of the listed features can be added to Pi-Hole by
installing additional software or by manually using SSH terminal and
reconfiguring one of the utilities Pi-Hole consists of.  However, in our
opinion, this cannot be legitimately counted as a Pi-Hole's feature.

   ###  <a href="#comparison-adblock" id="comparison-adblock" name="comparison-adblock">How does AdGuard Home compare to traditional ad blockers</a>

It depends.

DNS sinkholing is capable of blocking a big percentage of ads, but it lacks
the flexibility and the power of traditional ad blockers.  You can get a good
impression about the difference between these methods by reading [this
article][blog-adaway], which compares AdGuard for Android (a traditional ad
blocker) to hosts-level ad blockers (which are almost identical to DNS-based
blockers in their capabilities).  This level of protection is enough for some
users.

Additionally, using a DNS-based blocker can help to block ads, tracking and
analytics requests on other types of devices, such as SmartTVs, smart speakers
or other kinds of IoT devices (on which you can't install traditional ad
blockers).



   ###  <a href="#comparison-limitations" id="comparison-limitations" name="comparison-limitations">Known limitations</a>

Here are some examples of what cannot be blocked by a DNS-level blocker:

 *  YouTube, Twitch ads;

 *  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram sponsored posts.

Essentially, any advertising that shares a domain with content cannot be blocked
by a DNS-level blocker.

Is there a chance to handle this in the future?  DNS will never be enough to do
this.  Our only option is to use a content blocking proxy like what we do in the
standalone AdGuard applications.  We're [going to bring][issue-1228] this
feature support to AdGuard Home in the future.  Unfortunately, even in this
case, there still will be cases when this won't be enough or would require quite
a complicated configuration.

##  <a href="#how-to-build" id="how-to-build" name="how-to-build">How to build from source</a>

   ###  <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites" name="prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>

Run `make init` to prepare the development environment.

You will need this to build AdGuard Home:

 *  [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.20 or later;
 *  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v16 or later;
 *  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v8 or later;
 *  [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) v1.22.5 or later.



   ###  <a href="#building" id="building" name="building">Building</a>

Open your terminal and execute these commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome
cd AdGuardHome
make
```

  #### <a href="#building-node" id="building-node" name="building-node">Building with Node.js 17 and later</a>

In order to build AdGuard Home with Node.js 17 and later, specify
`--openssl-legacy-provider` option.

```sh
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

**NOTE:**  The non-standard `-j` flag is currently not supported, so building
with `make -j 4` or setting your `MAKEFLAGS` to include, for example, `-j 4` is
likely to break the build.  If you do have your `MAKEFLAGS` set to that, and you
don't want to change it, you can override it by running `make -j 1`.

Check the [`Makefile`][src-makefile] to learn about other commands.

  #### <a href="#building-cross" id="building-cross" name="building-cross">Building for a different platform</a>

You can build AdGuard Home for any OS/ARCH that Go supports.  In order to do
this, specify `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables as macros when running
`make`.

For example:

```sh
env GOOS='linux' GOARCH='arm64' make
```

or:

```sh
make GOOS='linux' GOARCH='arm64'
```

  ####  <a href="#preparing-releases" id="preparing-releases" name="preparing-releases">Preparing releases</a>

You'll need [`snapcraft`] to prepare a release build.  Once installed, run the
following command:

```sh
make build-release CHANNEL='...' VERSION='...'
```

See the [`build-release` target documentation][targ-release].

  ####  <a href="#docker-image" id="docker-image" name="docker-image">Docker image</a>

Run `make build-docker` to build the Docker image locally (the one that we
publish to DockerHub).  Please note, that we're using [Docker Buildx][buildx] to
build our official image.

You may need to prepare before using these builds:

 *  (Linux-only) Install Qemu:

    ```sh
    docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes --credential yes
    ```

 *  Prepare the builder:

    ```sh
    docker buildx create --name buildx-builder --driver docker-container --use
    ```

See the [`build-docker` target documentation][targ-docker].

  ####  <a href="#debugging-the-frontend" id="debugging-the-frontend" name="debugging-the-frontend">Debugging the frontend</a>

When you need to debug the frontend without recompiling the production version
every time, for example to check how your labels would look on a form, you can
run the frontend build a development environment.

1.  In a separate terminal, run:

    ```sh
    ( cd ./client/ && env NODE_ENV='development' npm run watch )
    ```

2.  Run your `AdGuardHome` binary with the `--local-frontend` flag, which
    instructs AdGuard Home to ignore the built-in frontend files and use those
    from the `./build/` directory.

3.  Now any changes you make in the `./client/` directory should be recompiled
    and become available on the web UI.  Make sure that you disable the browser
    cache to make sure that you actually get the recompiled version.

You are welcome to fork this repository, make your changes and [submit a pull
request][pr].  Please make sure you follow our [code guidelines][guide] though.

Please note that we don't expect people to contribute to both UI and backend
parts of the program simultaneously.  Ideally, the backend part is implemented
first, i.e. configuration, API, and the functionality itself.  The UI part can
be implemented later in a different pull request by a different person.

   ###  <a href="#test-unstable-versions" id="test-unstable-versions" name="test-unstable-versions">Test unstable versions</a>

There are two update channels that you can use:

 *  `beta`: beta versions of AdGuard Home.  More or less stable versions,
    usually released every two weeks or more often.

 *  `edge`: the newest version of AdGuard Home from the development branch.  New
    updates are pushed to this channel daily.

There are three options how you can install an unstable version:

1.  [Snap Store]: look for the `beta` and `edge` channels.

2.  [Docker Hub]: look for the `beta` and `edge` tags.

3.  Standalone builds.  Use the automated installation script or look for the
    available builds [on the Wiki][wiki-platf].

    Script to install a beta version:

    ```sh
    curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c beta
    ```

    Script to install an edge version:

    ```sh
    curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -c edge
    ```
