## [v0.107.53] - 2024-10-03

See also the [v0.107.53 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.53].

### Security

- Previous versions of AdGuard Home allowed users to add any system file it had access to as filters, exposing them to be world-readable.  To prevent this, AdGuard Home now allows adding filtering-rule list files only from files matching the patterns enumerated in the `filtering.safe_fs_patterns` property in the configuration file.

    We thank @itz-d0dgy for reporting this vulnerability, designated CVE-2024-36814, to us.

- Additionally, AdGuard Home will now try to change the permissions of its files and directories to more restrictive ones to prevent similar vulnerabilities as well as limit the access to the configuration.

    We thank @go-compile for reporting this vulnerability, designated CVE-2024-36586, to us.

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in [1.23.2][go-1.23.2].

### Added

- Support for 64-bit RISC-V architecture ([#5704]).

- Ecosia search engine is now supported in safe search ([#5009]).

### Changed

- Upstream server URL domain names requirements has been relaxed and now follow the same rules as their domain specifications.

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 28 to 29.

- The new array `filtering.safe_fs_patterns` contains glob patterns for paths of files that can be added as local filtering-rule lists.  The migration should add list files that have already been added, as well as the default value, `$DATA_DIR/userfilters/*`.

### Fixed

- Property `clients.runtime_sources.dhcp` in the configuration file not taking effect.

- Stale Google safe search domains list ([#7155]).

- Bing safe search from Edge sidebar ([#7154]).

- Text overflow on the query log page ([#7119]).

### Known issues

- Due to the complexity of the Windows permissions architecture and poor support from the standard Go library, we have to postpone the proper automated Windows fix until the next release.

    **Temporary workaround:**  Set the permissions of the `AdGuardHome` directory to more restrictive ones manually.  To do that:

    1. Locate the `AdGuardHome` directory.

    2. Right-click on it and navigate to *Properties → Security → Advanced.*

    3. (You might need to disable permission inheritance to make them more restricted.)

    4. Adjust to give the `Full control` access to only the user which runs AdGuard Home.  Typically, `Administrator`.

## [v0.107.52] - 2024-07-04

See also the [v0.107.52 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.52].

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in [Go 1.22.5][go-1.22.5].

### Added

- The ability to disable logging using the new `log.enabled` configuration property ([#7079]).

### Changed

- Frontend rewritten in TypeScript.

- The `systemd`-based service now uses `journal` for logging by default.  It also doesn't create the `/var/log/` directory anymore ([#7053]).

    **NOTE:** With an installed service for changes to take effect, you need to reinstall the service using `-r` flag of the [install script][install-script] or via the CLI (with root privileges):

    ```sh
    ./AdGuardHome -s uninstall
    ./AdGuardHome -s install
    ```

    Don't forget to backup your configuration file and other important data before reinstalling the service.

### Deprecated

- Node 18 support, Node 20 will be required in future releases.

### Fixed

- Panic caused by missing user-specific blocked services object in configuration file ([#7069]).

- Tracking `/etc/hosts` file changes causing panics within particular filesystems on start ([#7076]).

### Added

- Support for comments in the ipset file ([#5345]).

### Changed

- Private rDNS resolution now also affects `SOA` and `NS` requests ([#6882]).

- Rewrite rules mechanics were changed due to improved resolving in safe search.

### Deprecated

- Currently, AdGuard Home skips persistent clients that have duplicate fields when reading them from the configuration file.  This behaviour is deprecated and will cause errors on startup in a future release.

### Fixed

- Acceptance of duplicate UIDs for persistent clients at startup.  See also the section on client settings on the [Wiki page][wiki-config].

- YouTube restricted mode is not enforced by HTTPS queries on Firefox.

- Support for link-local subnets, i.e. `fe80::/16`, in the access settings ([#6192]).

- The ability to apply an invalid configuration for private rDNS, which led to server not starting.

- Ignoring query log for clients with ClientID set ([#5812]).

- Subdomains of `in-addr.arpa` and `ip6.arpa` containing zero-length prefix incorrectly considered invalid when specified for private rDNS upstream servers ([#6854]).

### Changed

- Time Zone Database is now embedded in the binary ([#6758]).

- Failed authentication attempts show the originating IP address in the logs, if the request came from a trusted proxy ([#5829]).

### Deprecated

- Go 1.22 support.  Future versions will require at least Go 1.23 to build.

- Currently, AdGuard Home uses a best-effort algorithm to fix invalid IDs of filtering-rule lists on startup.  This feature is deprecated, and invalid IDs will cause errors on startup in a future version.

- Node.JS 16.  Future versions will require at least Node.JS 18 to build.

### Fixed

- Resetting DNS upstream mode when applying unrelated settings ([#6851]).

- Symbolic links to the configuration file begin replaced by a copy of the real file upon startup on FreeBSD ([#6717]).

## [v0.107.46] - 2024-03-20

See also the [v0.107.46 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.46].

### Added

- Ability to disable the use of system hosts file information for query resolution ([#6610]).

- Ability to define custom directories for storage of query log files and statistics ([#5992]).

### Changed

- Private rDNS resolution (`dns.use_private_ptr_resolvers` in YAML configuration) now requires a valid "Private reverse DNS servers", when enabled ([#6820]).

    **NOTE:** Disabling private rDNS resolution behaves effectively the same as if no private reverse DNS servers provided by user and by the OS.

### Fixed

- Statistics for 7 days displayed by day on the dashboard graph ([#6712]).

- Missing "served from cache" label on long DNS server strings ([#6740]).

- Incorrect tracking of the system hosts file's changes ([#6711]).

## [v0.107.45] - 2024-03-06

See also the [v0.107.45 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.45].

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in [Go 1.21.8][go-1.21.8].

### Added

- Context menu item in the Query Log to add a Client to the Persistent client list ([#6679]).

### Changed

- Starting with this release our scripts are using Go's [forward compatibility mechanism][go-toolchain] for updating the Go version.

    **Important note for porters:**  This change means that if your `go` version is 1.21+ but is different from the one required by AdGuard Home, the `go` tool will automatically download the required version.

    If you want to use the version installed on your builder, run:

    ```sh
    go get go@$YOUR_VERSION
    go mod tidy
    ```

    and call `make` with `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`.

### Deprecated

- Go 1.21 support.  Future versions will require at least Go 1.22 to build.

### Fixed

- Missing IP addresses in logs when querying for domain names from the ignore lists.

- Blank page after resetting access clients ([#6634]).

- Wrong algorithm for caching bootstrapped upstream addresses ([#6723]).

### Removed

- Go 1.20 support, as it has reached end of life.

## [v0.107.44] - 2024-02-06

See also the [v0.107.44 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.44].

### Added

- Timezones in the Etc/ area to the timezone list ([#6568]).

- The schema version of the configuration file to the output of running `AdGuardHome` (or `AdGuardHome.exe`) with `-v --version` command-line options ([#6545]).

- Ability to disable plain-DNS serving via UI if an encrypted protocol is already used ([#1660]).

### Changed

- The bootstrapped upstream addresses are now updated according to the TTL of the bootstrap DNS response ([#6321]).

- Logging level of timeout errors is now `error` instead of `debug` ([#6574]).

- The field `"upstream_mode"` in `POST /control/dns_config` and `GET /control/dns_info` HTTP APIs now accepts `load_balance` value.  Check `openapi/CHANGELOG.md` for more details.

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 27 to 28.

- The new property `clients.persistent.*.uid`, which is a unique identifier of the persistent client.

- The properties `dns.all_servers` and `dns.fastest_addr` were removed, their values migrated to newly added field `dns.upstream_mode` that describes the logic through which upstreams will be used.  See also a [Wiki page][wiki-config].

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'dns':
        # …
        'all_servers': true
        'fastest_addr': true

    # AFTER:
    'dns':
        # …
        'upstream_mode': 'parallel'
    ```

    To rollback this change, remove the new field `upstream_mode`, set back `dns.all_servers` and `dns.fastest_addr` properties in `dns` section, and change the `schema_version` back to `27`.

### Fixed

- “Invalid AddrPort” in the *Private reverse DNS servers* section on the *Settings → DNS settings* page.

- Panic on using `--no-etc-hosts` flag ([#6644]).

- Schedule display in the client settings after creating or updating.

- Zero value in `querylog.size_memory` disables logging ([#6570]).

- Non-anonymized IP addresses on the dashboard ([#6584]).

- Maximum cache TTL requirement when editing minimum cache TTL in the Web UI ([#6409]).

- Load balancing algorithm stuck on a single server ([#6480]).

- Statistics for 7 days displayed as 168 hours on the dashboard.

- Pre-filling the Edit static lease window with data ([#6534]).

- Names defined in the `/etc/hosts` for a single address family wrongly considered undefined for another family ([#6541]).

- Omitted CNAME records in safe search results, which can cause YouTube to not work on iOS ([#6352]).

## [v0.107.37] - 2023-09-07

See also the [v0.107.37 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.37].

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the CVE-2023-39318, CVE-2023-39319, and CVE-2023-39320 Go vulnerabilities fixed in [Go 1.20.8][go-1.20.8].

### Added

- AdBlock-style syntax support for ignored domains in logs and statistics ([#5720]).

- [`Strict-Transport-Security`][hsts] header in the HTTP API and DNS-over-HTTPS responses when HTTPS is forced ([#2998]).  See [RFC 6797][rfc6797].

- UI for the schedule of the service-blocking pause ([#951]).

- IPv6 hints are now filtered in case IPv6 addresses resolving is disabled ([#6122]).

- The ability to set fallback DNS servers in the configuration file and the UI ([#3701]).

- While adding or updating blocklists, the title can now be parsed from `! Title:` definition of the blocklist's source ([#6020]).

- The ability to filter DNS HTTPS records including IPv4 and IPv6 hints ([#6053]).

- Two new metrics showing total number of responses from each upstream DNS server and their average processing time in the Web UI ([#1453]).

- The ability to set the port for the `pprof` debug API, see configuration changes below.

### Changed

- `$dnsrewrite` rules containing IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are now working consistently with legacy DNS rewrites and match the `AAAA` requests.

- For non-A and non-AAAA requests, which has been filtered, the NODATA response is returned if the blocking mode isn't set to `Null IP`.  In previous versions it returned NXDOMAIN response in such cases.

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 24 to 27.

- Ignore rules blocking `.` in `querylog.ignored` and `statistics.ignored` have been migrated to AdBlock syntax (`|.^`).  To rollback this change, restore the rules and change the `schema_version` back to `26`.

- Filtering-related settings have been moved from `dns` section of the YAML configuration file to the new section `filtering`:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:

      'parental_block_host':       'p.dns.adguard.com',
      'safebrowsing_block_host':   's.dns.adguard.com',
    ```

    To rollback this change, remove the new object `filtering`, set back filtering properties in `dns` section, and change the `schema_version` back to `25`.

- Property `debug_pprof` which used to setup profiling HTTP handler, is now moved to the new `pprof` object under `http` section.  The new object contains properties `enabled` and `port`:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'debug_pprof': true

    # AFTER:
    'http':
      'pprof':
        'enabled': true
        'port': 6060
    ```

    Note that the new default `6060` is used as default.  To rollback this change, remove the new object `pprof`, set back `debug_pprof`, and change the `schema_version` back to `24`.

### Fixed

- Incorrect display date on statistics graph ([#5793]).

- Missing query log entries and statistics on service restart ([#6100]).

- Occasional DNS-over-QUIC and DNS-over-HTTP/3 errors ([#6133]).

- Legacy DNS rewrites containing IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are now matching the `AAAA` requests, not `A` ([#6050]).

- File log configuration, such as `max_size`, being ignored ([#6093]).

- Panic on using a single-slash filtering rule.

- Panic on shutting down while DNS requests are in process of filtering ([#5948]).

### Changed

- Improved reliability filtering-rule list updates on Unix systems.

### Fixed

- Occasional client information lookup failures that could lead to the DNS server getting stuck ([#6006]).

- `bufio.Scanner: token too long` and other errors when trying to add filtering-rule lists with lines over 1024 bytes long or containing cosmetic rules ([#6003]).

## [v0.107.34] - 2023-07-12

See also the [v0.107.34 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.34].

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the CVE-2023-29406 Go vulnerability fixed in [Go 1.19.11][go-1.19.11].

### Added

- Ability to ignore queries for the root domain, such as `NS .` queries ([#5990]).

### Changed

- Improved CPU and RAM consumption during updates of filtering-rule lists.

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 23 to 24.

- Properties starting with `log_`, and `verbose` property, which used to set up logging are now moved to the new object `log` containing new properties `file`, `max_backups`, `max_size`, `max_age`, `compress`, `local_time`, and `verbose`:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'log_file': ""
    'log_max_backups': 0
    'log_max_size': 100
    'log_max_age': 3
    'log_compress': false
    'log_localtime': false
    'verbose': false

    # AFTER:
    'log':
        'file': ""
        'max_backups': 0
        'max_size': 100
        'max_age': 3
        'compress': false
        'local_time': false
        'verbose': false
    ```

    To rollback this change, remove the new object `log`, set back `log_` and `verbose` properties and change the `schema_version` back to `23`.

### Deprecated

- Default exposure of the non-standard ports 784 and 8853 for DNS-over-QUIC in the `Dockerfile`.

- The ability to edit rewrite rules via `PUT /control/rewrite/update` HTTP API and the Web UI ([#1577]).

### Changed

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 20 to 23.

- Properties `bind_host`, `bind_port`, and `web_session_ttl` which used to setup web UI binding configuration, are now moved to a new object `http` containing new properties `address` and `session_ttl`:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'bind_host': '1.2.3.4'
    'bind_port': 8080
    'web_session_ttl': 720

    # AFTER:
    'http':
      'address': '1.2.3.4:8080'
      'session_ttl': '720h'
    ```

    Note that the new `http.session_ttl` property is now a duration string.  To rollback this change, remove the new object `http`, set back `bind_host`, `bind_port`, `web_session_ttl`,  and change the `schema_version` back to `22`.

- Property `clients.persistent.blocked_services`, which in schema versions 21 and earlier used to be a list containing ids of blocked services, is now an object containing ids and schedule for blocked services:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'clients':
      'persistent':
        - 'name': 'client-name'
          'blocked_services':
          - id_1
          - id_2

    # AFTER:
    'clients':
      'persistent':
      - 'name': client-name
        'blocked_services':
          'ids':
          - id_1
          - id_2
        'schedule':
          'time_zone': 'Local'
          'sun':
            'start': '0s'
            'end': '24h'
          'mon':
            'start': '1h'
            'end': '23h'
    ```

    To rollback this change, replace `clients.persistent.blocked_services` object with the list of ids of blocked services and change the `schema_version` back to `21`.

- Property `dns.blocked_services`, which in schema versions 20 and earlier used to be a list containing ids of blocked services, is now an object containing ids and schedule for blocked services:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'blocked_services':
    - id_1
    - id_2

    # AFTER:
    'blocked_services':
      'ids':
      - id_1
      - id_2
      'schedule':
        'time_zone': 'Local'
        'sun':
          'start': '0s'
          'end': '24h'
        'mon':
          'start': '10m'
          'end': '23h30m'
        'tue':
          'start': '20m'
          'end': '23h'
        'wed':
          'start': '30m'
          'end': '22h30m'
        'thu':
          'start': '40m'
          'end': '22h'
        'fri':
          'start': '50m'
          'end': '21h30m'
        'sat':
          'start': '1h'
          'end': '21h'
    ```

    To rollback this change, replace `dns.blocked_services` object with the list of ids of blocked services and change the `schema_version` back to `20`.

### Deprecated

- The `HEALTHCHECK` section and the use of `tini` in the `ENTRYPOINT` section in `Dockerfile` ([#5939]).  They cause a lot of issues, especially with tools like `docker-compose` and `podman`, and will be removed in a future release.

- Flags `-h`, `--host`, `-p`, `--port` have been deprecated.  The `-h` flag will work as an alias for `--help`, instead of the deprecated `--host` in the future releases.

### Fixed

- Ignoring of `/etc/hosts` file when resolving the hostnames of upstream DNS servers ([#5902]).

- Excessive error logging when using DNS-over-QUIC ([#5285]).

- Inability to set `bind_host` in `AdGuardHome.yaml` in Docker ([#4231], [#4235]).

- The blocklists can now be deleted properly ([#5700]).

- Queries with the question-section target `.`, for example `NS .`, are now counted in the statistics and correctly shown in the query log ([#5910]).

- Safe Search not working with `AAAA` queries for domains that don't have `AAAA` records ([#5913]).

## [v0.107.28] - 2023-04-12

See also the [v0.107.28 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.28].

### Added

- The ability to exclude client activity from the query log or statistics by using the new properties `ignore_querylog` and `ignore_statistics` of the items of the `clients.persistent` array ([#1717], [#4299]).  The UI changes are coming in the upcoming releases.

- Better profiling information when `debug_pprof` is set to `true`.

- IPv6 support in Safe Search for some services.

- The ability to make bootstrap DNS lookups prefer IPv6 addresses to IPv4 ones using the new `dns.bootstrap_prefer_ipv6` configuration file property ([#4262]).

- Docker container's healthcheck ([#3290]).

- The new HTTP API `POST /control/protection`, that updates protection state and adds an optional pause duration ([#1333]).  The format of request body is described in `openapi/openapi.yaml`.  The duration of this pause could also be set with the property `protection_disabled_until` in the `dns` object of the YAML configuration file.

- The ability to create a static DHCP lease from a dynamic one more easily ([#3459]).

- Two new HTTP APIs, `PUT /control/stats/config/update` and `GET control/stats/config`, which can be used to set and receive the query log configuration.  See `openapi/openapi.yaml` for the full description.

- Two new HTTP APIs, `PUT /control/querylog/config/update` and `GET control/querylog/config`, which can be used to set and receive the statistics configuration.  See `openapi/openapi.yaml` for the full description.

- The ability to set custom IP for EDNS Client Subnet by using the DNS-server configuration section on the DNS settings page in the UI ([#1472]).

- The ability to manage Safe Search for each service by using the new `safe_search` property ([#1163]).

### Changed

- ARPA domain names containing a subnet within private networks now also considered private, behaving closer to [RFC 6761][rfc6761] ([#5567]).

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 17 to 20.

- Property `statistics.interval`, which in schema versions 19 and earlier used to be an integer number of days, is now a string with a human-readable duration:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'statistics':
      # …
      'interval': 1

    # AFTER:
    'statistics':
      # …
      'interval': '24h'
    ```

  To rollback this change, convert the property back into days and change the `schema_version` back to `19`.

- The `dns.safesearch_enabled` property has been replaced with `safe_search` object containing per-service settings.

- The `clients.persistent.safesearch_enabled` property has been replaced with `safe_search` object containing per-service settings.

    ```yaml
      # BEFORE:
      'safesearch_enabled': true

      # AFTER:
      'safe_search':
        'enabled': true
        'bing': true
        'duckduckgo': true
        'google': true
        'pixabay': true
        'yandex': true
        'youtube': true
    ```

    To rollback this change, move the value of `dns.safe_search.enabled` into the `dns.safesearch_enabled`, then remove `dns.safe_search` property.  Do the same client's specific `clients.persistent.safesearch` and then change the `schema_version` back to `17`.

### Deprecated

- The `POST /control/safesearch/enable` HTTP API is deprecated.  Use the new `PUT /control/safesearch/settings` API.

- The `POST /control/safesearch/disable` HTTP API is deprecated.  Use the new `PUT /control/safesearch/settings` API

- The `safesearch_enabled` property is deprecated in the following HTTP APIs:
    - `GET /control/clients`;
    - `POST /control/clients/add`;
    - `POST /control/clients/update`;
    - `GET /control/clients/find?ip0=...&ip1=...&ip2=...`.

    Check `openapi/openapi.yaml` for more details.

- The `GET /control/stats_info` HTTP API; use the new `GET /control/stats/config` API instead.

    **NOTE:** If interval is custom then it will be equal to `90` days for compatibility reasons.  See `openapi/openapi.yaml` and `openapi/CHANGELOG.md`.

- The `POST /control/stats_config` HTTP API; use the new `PUT /control/stats/config/update` API instead.

- The `GET /control/querylog_info` HTTP API; use the new `GET /control/querylog/config` API instead.

    **NOTE:** If interval is custom then it will be equal to `90` days for compatibility reasons.  See `openapi/openapi.yaml` and `openapi/CHANGELOG.md`.

- The `POST /control/querylog_config` HTTP API; use the new `PUT /control/querylog/config/update` API instead.

### Fixed

- Logging of the client's IP address after failed login attempts ([#5701]).

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the CVE-2023-24532 Go vulnerability fixed in [Go 1.19.7][go-1.19.7].

### Added

- The ability to set custom IP for EDNS Client Subnet by using the new `dns.edns_client_subnet.use_custom` and `dns.edns_client_subnet.custom_ip` properties ([#1472]).  The UI changes are coming in the upcoming releases.

- The ability to use `dnstype` rules in the disallowed domains list ([#5468]).  This allows dropping requests based on their question types.

### Changed

#### Configuration changes

- Property `edns_client_subnet`, which in schema versions 16 and earlier used to be a part of the `dns` object, is now part of the `dns.edns_client_subnet` object:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'dns':
      # …
      'edns_client_subnet': false

    # AFTER:
    'dns':
      # …
      'edns_client_subnet':
        'enabled': false
        'use_custom': false
        'custom_ip': ''
    ```

    To rollback this change, move the value of `dns.edns_client_subnet.enabled` into the `dns.edns_client_subnet`, remove the properties `dns.edns_client_subnet.enabled`, `dns.edns_client_subnet.use_custom`, `dns.edns_client_subnet.custom_ip`, and change the `schema_version` back to `16`.

### Fixed

- Obsolete value of the Interface MTU DHCP option is now omitted ([#5281]).

- Various dark theme bugs ([#5439], [#5441], [#5442], [#5515]).

- Automatic update on MIPS64 and little-endian 32-bit MIPS architectures ([#5270], [#5373]).

See also the [v0.107.24 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.24].

### Security

- Go version has been updated, both because Go 1.18 has reached end of life an to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in [Go 1.19.6][go-1.19.6].

### Added

- The ability to disable statistics by using the new `statistics.enabled` property.  Previously it was necessary to set the `statistics_interval` to 0, losing the previous value ([#1717], [#4299]).

- The ability to exclude domain names from the query log or statistics by using the new `querylog.ignored` or `statistics.ignored` properties ([#1717], [#4299]).  The UI changes are coming in the upcoming releases.

### Changed

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 14 to 16.

- Property `statistics_interval`, which in schema versions 15 and earlier used to be a part of the `dns` object, is now a part of the `statistics` object:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'dns':
      # …
      'statistics_interval': 1

    # AFTER:
    'statistics':
      # …
      'interval': 1
    ```

    To rollback this change, move the property back into the `dns` object and change the `schema_version` back to `15`.

- The properties `dns.querylog_enabled`, `dns.querylog_file_enabled`, `dns.querylog_interval`, and `dns.querylog_size_memory` have been moved to the new `querylog` object.

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'dns':
      'querylog_enabled': true
      'querylog_file_enabled': true
      'querylog_interval': '2160h'
      'querylog_size_memory': 1000

    # AFTER:
    'querylog':
      'enabled': true
      'file_enabled': true
      'interval': '2160h'
      'size_memory': 1000
      'ignored': []
    ```

    To rollback this change, rename and move properties back into the `dns` object, remove `querylog` object and `querylog.ignored` property, and change the `schema_version` back to `14`.

### Deprecated

- Go 1.19 support.  Future versions will require at least Go 1.20 to build.

### Fixed

- Setting the AD (Authenticated Data) flag on responses that have the DO (DNSSEC OK) flag set but not the AD flag ([#5479]).

- Client names resolved via reverse DNS not being updated ([#4939]).

- The icon for League Of Legends on the Blocked services page ([#5433]).

### Removed

- Go 1.18 support, as it has reached end of life.

### Added

- DNS64 support ([#5117]).  The function may be enabled with new `use_dns64` property under `dns` object in the configuration along with `dns64_prefixes`, the set of exclusion prefixes to filter AAAA responses.  The Well-Known Prefix (`64:ff9b::/96`) is used if no custom prefixes are specified.

### Fixed

- Filtering rules with `*` as the hostname not working properly ([#5245]).

- Various dark theme bugs ([#5375]).

### Removed

- The “beta frontend” and the corresponding APIs.  They never quite worked properly, and the future new version of AdGuard Home API will probably be different.

    Correspondingly, the configuration parameter `beta_bind_port` has been removed as well.

### Added

- Experimental Dark UI theme ([#613]).

- The new HTTP API `PUT /control/profile/update`, that updates current user language and UI theme.  The format of request body is described in `openapi/openapi.yaml`.

### Changed

- The HTTP API `GET /control/profile` now returns enhanced object with current user's name, language, and UI theme.  The format of response body is described in `openapi/openapi.yaml` and `openapi/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Fixed

- `AdGuardHome --update` freezing when another instance of AdGuard Home is running ([#4223], [#5191]).

- The `--update` flag performing an update even when there is no version change.

- Failing HTTPS redirection on saving the encryption settings ([#4898]).

- Zeroing rules counter of erroneously edited filtering rule lists ([#5290]).

- The ability to clear the DNS cache ([#5190]).

### Changed

- DHCP server initialization errors are now logged at debug level if the server itself disabled ([#4944]).

### Fixed

- Wrong validation error messages on the DHCP configuration page ([#5208]).

- Slow upstream checks making the API unresponsive ([#5193]).

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the CVE-2022-41716 Go vulnerability fixed in [Go 1.18.8][go-1.18.8].

### Added

- The warning message when adding a certificate having no IP addresses ([#4898]).

- Several new blockable services ([#3972]).  Those will now be more in sync with the services that are already blockable in AdGuard DNS.

- A new HTTP API, `GET /control/blocked_services/all`, that lists all available blocked services and their data, such as SVG icons ([#3972]).

- The new optional `tls.override_tls_ciphers` property, which allows overriding TLS ciphers used by AdGuard Home ([#4925], [#4990]).

- The ability to serve DNS on link-local IPv6 addresses ([#2926]).

- The ability to put [ClientIDs][clientid] into DNS-over-HTTPS hostnames as opposed to URL paths ([#3418]).  Note that AdGuard Home checks the server name only if the URL does not contain a ClientID.

### Changed

- DNS-over-TLS resolvers aren't returned anymore when the configured TLS certificate contains no IP addresses ([#4927]).

- Responses with `SERVFAIL` code are now cached for at least 30 seconds.

### Deprecated

- The `GET /control/blocked_services/services` HTTP API; use the new `GET /control/blocked_services/all` API instead ([#3972]).

### Fixed

- ClientIDs not working when using DNS-over-HTTPS with HTTP/3.

- Editing the URL of an enabled rule list also includes validation of the filter contents preventing from saving a bad one ([#4916]).

- The default value of `dns.cache_size` accidentally set to 0 has now been reverted to 4 MiB ([#5010]).

- Responses for which the DNSSEC validation had explicitly been omitted aren't cached now ([#4942]).

## [v0.107.15] - 2022-10-03

See also the [v0.107.15 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.15].

### Security

- As an additional CSRF protection measure, AdGuard Home now ensures that requests that change its state but have no body (such as `POST /control/stats_reset` requests) do not have a `Content-Type` header set on them ([#4970]).

### Added

#### Experimental HTTP/3 Support

See [#3955] and the related issues for more details.  These features are still experimental and may break or change in the future.

- DNS-over-HTTP/3 DNS and web UI client request support.  This feature must be explicitly enabled by setting the new property `dns.serve_http3` in the configuration file to `true`.

- DNS-over-HTTP upstreams can now upgrade to HTTP/3 if the new configuration file property `dns.use_http3_upstreams` is set to `true`.

- Upstreams with forced DNS-over-HTTP/3 and no fallback to prior HTTP versions using the `h3://` scheme.

### Fixed

## [v0.107.14] - 2022-09-29

See also the [v0.107.14 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.14].

### Security

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been discovered.  We thank Daniel Elkabes from Mend.io for reporting this vulnerability to us.  This is [CVE-2022-32175].

#### `SameSite` Policy

The `SameSite` policy on the AdGuard Home session cookies is now set to `Lax`.  Which means that the only cross-site HTTP request for which the browser is allowed to send the session cookie is navigating to the AdGuard Home domain.

**Users are strongly advised to log out, clear browser cache, and log in again after updating.**

#### Removal Of Plain-Text APIs (BREAKING API CHANGE)

We have implemented several measures to prevent such vulnerabilities in the future, but some of these measures break backwards compatibility for the sake of better protection.

The following APIs, which previously accepted or returned `text/plain` data, now accept or return data as JSON.  All new formats for the request and response bodies are documented in `openapi/openapi.yaml` and `openapi/CHANGELOG.md`.

- `GET  /control/i18n/current_language`;
- `POST /control/dhcp/find_active_dhcp`;
- `POST /control/filtering/set_rules`;
- `POST /control/i18n/change_language`.

#### Stricter Content-Type Checks (BREAKING API CHANGE)

All JSON APIs that expect a body now check if the request actually has `Content-Type` set to `application/json`.

#### Other Security Changes

- Weaker cipher suites that use the CBC (cipher block chaining) mode of operation have been disabled ([#2993]).

### Added

- Support for plain (unencrypted) HTTP/2 ([#4930]).  This is useful for AdGuard Home installations behind a reverse proxy.

### Fixed

- Incorrect path template in DDR responses ([#4927]).

## [v0.107.13] - 2022-09-14

See also the [v0.107.13 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.13].

### Added

- The new optional `dns.ipset_file` property, which can be set in the configuration file.  It allows loading the `ipset` list from a file, just like `dns.upstream_dns_file` does for upstream servers ([#4686]).

### Changed

- The minimum DHCP message size is reassigned back to BOOTP's constraint of 300 bytes ([#4904]).

### Fixed

- Panic when adding a static lease within the disabled DHCP server ([#4722]).

## [v0.107.12] - 2022-09-07

See also the [v0.107.12 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.12].

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the CVE-2022-27664 and CVE-2022-32190 Go vulnerabilities fixed in [Go 1.18.6][go-1.18.6].

### Added

- New `bool`, `dur`, `u8`, and `u16` DHCP options to provide more convenience on options control by setting values in a human-readable format ([#4705]).  See also a [Wiki page][wiki-dhcp-opts].

- New `del` DHCP option which removes the corresponding option from server's response ([#4337]).  See also a [Wiki page][wiki-dhcp-opts].

    **NOTE:** This modifier affects all the parameters in the response and not only the requested ones.

- A new HTTP API, `GET /control/blocked_services/services`, that lists all available blocked services ([#4535]).

### Changed

- The DHCP options handling is now closer to the [RFC 2131][rfc-2131] ([#4705]).

- When the DHCP server is enabled, queries for domain names under `dhcp.local_domain_name` not pointing to real DHCP client hostnames are now processed by filters ([#4865]).

- The `DHCPREQUEST` handling is now closer to the [RFC 2131][rfc-2131] ([#4863]).

- The internal DNS client, used to resolve hostnames of external clients and also during automatic updates, now respects the upstream mode settings for the main DNS client ([#4403]).

### Deprecated

- Ports 784 and 8853 for DNS-over-QUIC in Docker images.  Users who still serve DoQ on these ports are encouraged to move to the standard port 853.  These ports will be removed from the `EXPOSE` section of our `Dockerfile` in a future release.

- Go 1.18 support.  Future versions will require at least Go 1.19 to build.

### Fixed

- The length of the DHCP server's response is now at least 576 bytes as per [RFC 2131][rfc-2131] recommendation ([#4337]).

- Dynamic leases created with empty hostnames ([#4745]).

- Unnecessary logging of non-critical statistics errors ([#4850]).

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the CVE-2022-1705, CVE-2022-32148, CVE-2022-30631, and other Go vulnerabilities fixed in [Go 1.17.12][go-1.17.12].

### Fixed

- DHCP lease validation incorrectly letting users assign the IP address of the gateway as the address of the lease ([#4698]).

- Updater no longer expects a hardcoded name for  `AdGuardHome` executable ([#4219]).

- Inconsistent names of runtime clients from hosts files ([#4683]).

- PTR requests for addresses leased by DHCP will now be resolved into hostnames under `dhcp.local_domain_name` ([#4699]).

- Broken service installation on OpenWrt ([#4677]).

## [v0.107.7] - 2022-06-06

See also the [v0.107.7 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.107.7].

### Security

- Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the [CVE-2022-29526], [CVE-2022-30634], [CVE-2022-30629], [CVE-2022-30580], and [CVE-2022-29804] Go vulnerabilities.

- Enforced password strength policy ([#3503]).

### Added

- Support for the final DNS-over-QUIC standard, [RFC 9250][rfc-9250] ([#4592]).

- Support upstreams for subdomains of a domain only ([#4503]).

- The ability to control each source of runtime clients separately via `clients.runtime_sources` configuration object ([#3020]).

- The ability to customize the set of networks that are considered private through the new `dns.private_networks` property in the configuration file ([#3142]).

- EDNS Client-Subnet information in the request details section of a query log record ([#3978]).

- Support for hostnames for plain UDP upstream servers using the `udp://` scheme ([#4166]).

- Logs are now collected by default on FreeBSD and OpenBSD when AdGuard Home is installed as a service ([#4213]).

### Changed

- On OpenBSD, the daemon script now uses the recommended `/bin/ksh` shell instead of the `/bin/sh` one ([#4533]).  To apply this change, backup your data and run `AdGuardHome -s uninstall && AdGuardHome -s install`.

- The default DNS-over-QUIC port number is now `853` instead of `754` in accordance with [RFC 9250][rfc-9250] ([#4276]).

- Reverse DNS now has a greater priority as the source of runtime clients' information than ARP neighborhood.

- Improved detection of runtime clients through more resilient ARP processing ([#3597]).

- The TTL of responses served from the optimistic cache is now lowered to 10 seconds.

- Domain-specific private reverse DNS upstream servers are now validated to allow only `*.in-addr.arpa` and `*.ip6.arpa` domains pointing to locally-served networks ([#3381]).

    **NOTE:**  If you already have invalid entries in your configuration, consider removing them manually, since they essentially had no effect.

- Response filtering is now performed using the record types of the answer section of messages as opposed to the type of the question ([#4238]).

- Instead of adding the build time information, the build scripts now use the standardized environment variable [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`][repr] to add the date of the commit from which the binary was built ([#4221]).  This should simplify reproducible builds for package maintainers and those who compile their own AdGuard Home.

- The property `local_domain_name` is now in the `dhcp` object in the configuration file to avoid confusion ([#3367]).

- The `dns.bogus_nxdomain` property in the configuration file now supports CIDR notation alongside IP addresses ([#1730]).

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 12 to 14.

- Object `clients`, which in schema versions 13 and earlier was an array of actual persistent clients, is now consist of `persistent` and `runtime_sources` properties:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'clients':
    - name: client-name
      # …

    # AFTER:
    'clients':
      'persistent':
        - name: client-name
          # …
      'runtime_sources':
        whois: true
        arp: true
        rdns: true
        dhcp: true
        hosts: true
    ```

    The value for `clients.runtime_sources.rdns` property is taken from `dns.resolve_clients` property.  To rollback this change, remove the `runtime_sources` property, move the contents of `persistent` into the `clients` itself, the value of `clients.runtime_sources.rdns` into the `dns.resolve_clients`, and change the `schema_version` back to `13`.

- Property `local_domain_name`, which in schema versions 12 and earlier used to be a part of the `dns` object, is now a part of the `dhcp` object:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'dns':
      # …
      'local_domain_name': 'lan'

    # AFTER:
    'dhcp':
      # …
      'local_domain_name': 'lan'
    ```

    To rollback this change, move the property back into the `dns` object and change the `schema_version` back to `12`.

### Deprecated

- The `--no-etc-hosts` option.  Its functionality is now controlled by `clients.runtime_sources.hosts` configuration property.  v0.109.0 will remove the flag completely.

### Fixed

- Query log occasionally going into an infinite loop ([#4591]).

- Service startup on boot on systems using SysV-init ([#4480]).

- Detection of the stopped service status on macOS and Linux ([#4273]).

- Case-sensitive ClientID ([#4542]).

- Slow version update queries making other HTTP APIs unresponsive ([#4499]).

- ARP tables refreshing process causing excessive PTR requests ([#3157]).

- Permissions on filter files are now `0o644` instead of `0o600` ([#3198]).

#### Configuration changes

In this release, the schema version has changed from 10 to 12.

- Property `dns.querylog_interval`, which in schema versions 11 and earlier used to be an integer number of days, is now a string with a human-readable duration:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'dns':
      # …
      'querylog_interval': 90

    # AFTER:
    'dns':
      # …
      'querylog_interval': '2160h'
    ```

    To rollback this change, convert the property back into days and change the `schema_version` back to `11`.

- Property `rlimit_nofile`, which in schema versions 10 and earlier used to be on the top level, is now moved to the new `os` object:

    ```yaml
    # BEFORE:
    'rlimit_nofile': 42

    # AFTER:
    'os':
      'group': ''
      'rlimit_nofile': 42
      'user': ''
    ```

    To rollback this change, move the property on the top level and change the `schema_version` back to `10`.

[ms-v0.105.1]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/milestone/31?closed=1

## [v0.105.0] - 2021-02-10

See also the [v0.105.0 GitHub milestone][ms-v0.105.0].

### Added

- Added more services to the "Blocked services" list ([#2224], [#2401]).

- `ipset` subdomain matching, just like `dnsmasq` does ([#2179]).

- ClientID support for DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-QUIC, and DNS-over-TLS ([#1383]).

- The new `dnsrewrite` modifier for filters ([#2102]).

- The host checking API and the query logs API can now return multiple matched rules ([#2102]).

- Detecting of network interface configured to have static IP address via `/etc/network/interfaces` ([#2302]).

- DNSCrypt protocol support ([#1361]).

- A 5 second wait period until a DHCP server's network interface gets an IP address ([#2304]).

- `dnstype` modifier for filters ([#2337]).

- HTTP API request body size limit ([#2305]).

### Changed

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is now only set to the same origin as the domain, but with an HTTP scheme as opposed to `*` ([#2484]).

- `workDir` now supports symlinks.

- Stopped mounting together the directories `/opt/adguardhome/conf` and `/opt/adguardhome/work` in our Docker images ([#2589]).

- When `dns.bogus_nxdomain` option is used, the server will now transform responses if there is at least one bogus address instead of all of them ([#2394]).  The new behavior is the same as in `dnsmasq`.

- Post-updating relaunch possibility is now determined OS-dependently ([#2231], [#2391]).

- Made the mobileconfig HTTP API more robust and predictable, add parameters and improve error response ([#2358]).

- Improved HTTP requests handling and timeouts ([#2343]).

- Our snap package now uses the `core20` image as its base ([#2306]).

- New build system and various internal improvements ([#2271], [#2276], [#2297], [#2509], [#2552], [#2639], [#2646]).

### Deprecated

- Go 1.14 support.  v0.106.0 will require at least Go 1.15 to build.

- The `darwin/386` port.  It will be removed in v0.106.0.

- The `"rule"` and `"filter_id"` property in `GET /filtering/check_host` and `GET /querylog` responses.  They will be removed in v0.106.0 ([#2102]).

### Fixed

- Autoupdate bug in the Darwin (macOS) version ([#2630]).

- Unnecessary conversions from `string` to `net.IP`, and vice versa ([#2508]).

- Inability to set DNS cache TTL limits ([#2459]).

- Possible freezes on slower machines ([#2225]).

- A mitigation against records being shown in the wrong order on the query log page ([#2293]).

- A JSON parsing error in query log ([#2345]).

- Incorrect detection of the IPv6 address of an interface as well as another infinite loop in the `/dhcp/find_active_dhcp` HTTP API ([#2355]).

### Removed

- The undocumented ability to use hostnames as any of `bind_host` values in configuration.  Documentation requires them to be valid IP addresses, and now the implementation makes sure that that is the case ([#2508]).

- `Dockerfile` ([#2276]).  Replaced with the script `scripts/make/build-docker.sh` which uses `scripts/make/Dockerfile`.

- Support for pre-v0.99.3 format of query logs ([#2102]).
