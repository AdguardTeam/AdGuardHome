  rules ([#2102]).

### Changed

- `workDir` now supports symlinks.
- Stopped mounting together the directories `/opt/adguardhome/conf` and
  `/opt/adguardhome/work` in our Docker images ([#2589]).
- When `dns.bogus_nxdomain` option is used, the server will now transform
  responses if there is at least one bogus address instead of all of them
  ([#2394]).  The new behavior is the same as in `dnsmasq`.
- Post-updating relaunch possibility is now determined OS-dependently ([#2231],
  [#2391]).
- Made the mobileconfig HTTP API more robust and predictable, add parameters and
  improve error response ([#2358]).
- Improved HTTP requests handling and timeouts ([#2343]).
- Our snap package now uses the `core20` image as its base ([#2306]).
- New build system and various internal improvements ([#2271], [#2276], [#2297],
  [#2509], [#2552]).

### Deprecated

- Go 1.14 support.  v0.106.0 will require at least Go 1.15 to build.
- The `darwin/386` port.  It will be removed in v0.106.0.
- The `"rule"` and `"filter_id"` fields in `GET /filtering/check_host` and
  `GET /querylog` responses.  They will be removed in v0.106.0 ([#2102]).

### Fixed

- Autoupdate bug in the Darwin (macOS) version ([#2630]).
- Unnecessary conversions from `string` to `net.IP`, and vice versa ([#2508]).
- Inability to set DNS cache TTL limits ([#2459]).
- Possible freezes on slower machines ([#2225]).
- A mitigation against records being shown in the wrong order on the query log
  page ([#2293]).
- A JSON parsing error in query log ([#2345]).
- Incorrect detection of the IPv6 address of an interface as well as another
  infinite loop in the `/dhcp/find_active_dhcp` HTTP API ([#2355]).

[#2508]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/2508
[#2630]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/2630

### Removed

- The undocumented ability to use hostnames as any of `bind_host` values in
  configuration.  Documentation requires them to be valid IP addresses, and now
  the implementation makes sure that that is the case ([#2508]).
- `Dockerfile` ([#2276]).  Replaced with the script
  `scripts/make/build-docker.sh` which uses `scripts/make/Dockerfile`.
- Support for pre-v0.99.3 format of query logs ([#2102]).

## [v0.104.3] - 2020-11-19

### Fixed

- The accidentally exposed profiler HTTP API ([#2336]).

## [v0.104.2] - 2020-11-19

### Added

- This changelog :-) ([#2294]).
- `HACKING.md`, a guide for developers.

### Changed

- Improved tests output ([#2273]).

### Fixed

- Query logs from file not loading after the ones buffered in memory ([#2325]).
- Unnecessary errors in query logs when switching between log files ([#2324]).
- `404 Not Found` errors on the DHCP settings page on Windows.  The page now
  correctly shows that DHCP is not currently available on that OS ([#2295]).
- Infinite loop in `/dhcp/find_active_dhcp` ([#2301]).
